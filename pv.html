              The start of year 2023 wasn't much fun but as the months passed away firstly i went to <b>Colaba Causeway</b> which is situated in <b>Churchgate,Mumbai</b> then during monsoon i went to <b>Sanjay Gandhi National Park</b> which is located in <b>Borivali,Mumbai.</b>Mostly during this i spent my time travelling nearby locations, but i was wrong at the end of the i made a trip to <b>Sikar & Jaipur,Rajasthan</b> and from there went to <b>Vrindavan,Uttar Pradesh</b> and visited all the nearby places like <b>Gokul,Barsana,Nandgaon & Mathura.</b> Really it was a overwhelming trip that i ever had and was very auspicious.
