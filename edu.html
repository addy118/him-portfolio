            Completed my School from SSC board then went for the best college for my Junior College FYJC & SYJC which was affiliated with Mumbai University and was under Maharashtra State Board. <br>
            Thinking out of the box just tried to attempt JEE 2022 exam and secured good percentile but not sufficient enough to get a dream university. <br>
            Attempting the CET 2022 exam was a life changing moment where i secured best mark and opted for my university studies which i'm currently pursuing in TCET. <br>
            Will try to go for the Masters in Enginnering through Information Technology and will try to achieve everything which i thought as kid.
